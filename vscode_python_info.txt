Python VSCode

Setup
	- Install python
      In Windows 10 you can choose to have several Python versions, usually under C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python##. Just make sure you change Environment variables C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python## and C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python##\Scripts accordingly. 
      - Dir: C:\Users\michael.lean\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python27
             C:\Users\michael.lean\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python38
      - Add both these paths to the Environment 'System Variables', not User.
      - rename the pythyon exe's in c:\windows as these are used by default in vscode
      - Add the interpreter paths in vscode. then RESTART vscode.
	- Install vscode packages
      - Bonus tip in Windows 10. If you don't have environment variable setup, and you type 'python' in VSCode terminal, it'll point to C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WindowsApps\python.exe, which just opens up python link in Windows AppStore
	- test: python --version.
	  If error see below.
	- create virtual env in python directory
	  activate virtual env & confirm you are in the virtual env.
	- Update pip if required: py -3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
	- Intsall black formatter: In terminal type: pip install black
	- py -m pip install --upgrade pip
    - pip install boto3

	  
ERROR: Permission Denied when running python:
		https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56974927/permission-denied-trying-to-run-python-on-windows-10
		
		- This is caused by a conflict with the version of Python that was recently added into the Windows Store. 
		  It looks like this added two "stubs" called python.exe and python3.exe into the %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WindowsApps folder, 
		  and in my case, this was inserted before my existing Python executable's entry in the PATH.

		- Fix
		  - Move this entry below the correct Python folder (partially) corrected the issue.
		  - Type: manage app execution aliases into the Windows search prompt and disable both of the store versions of Python.


Virtual Environment
  After opening python terminal, you can setup virtual env as follows.
    Type: py -3 -m venv py3
          -m  ...pass module
	  	  -3  ...version of python for virtual env
	  	  py3 ...virtual env folder to create in current location
    To select/confirm you are using the venv. Check the python info in the taskbar. Click it to change env's.
    - To setup other venv's to use the vscode can't find. Update settings.json with "python.pythonPath": "path\\..."
    
    - Activate virtual env: 	source .venv/Scripts/activate
    - Deactivate virtual env: 	deactivate   
  
  
Import modules
  - in terminal type: pip install <module>
